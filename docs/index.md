# Using QGIS

## What is a Geographic Information System (GIS)?

Software that lets you visualize, manipulate and analyze data that has some type
of geographic element.

More information and examples from [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/geographic-information-system-gis/).

## Types of "features"

Working with GIS software, you'll encounter three primary types of "shapes":
* Points
* Lines
* Polygons

### Points

Individual locations on a map, each with a set of geographic coordinates.

### Lines

Geographic data that connects two points in space together; that connection can
be a straight line that covers the shortest distance possible, or it can curve
and zig-zag. Think roadways and rivers.

### Polygons

Enclosed shapes that represent a geographic area. Think countries, states,
municipal boundaries and real estate parcels.
